# Churn Prediction in Prepaid Telecom Customers
This project focuses on churn prediction for prepaid customers in the Indian and Southeast Asian 
telecom markets. Unlike postpaid customers, prepaid users may stop using services without notifying
the operator, making churn prediction critical and complex.
